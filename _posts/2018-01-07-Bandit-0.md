This set of exercises was created to indroduce beginners to the linux environment, provide the basic tools needed to navigate navigate a linux environment, and foster problem solving and investigative techniques.

The main things to remember here are to read the clues carefully. *Almost* everything one needs to solve these puzzles is given in the clues. Each clue is provided with a list of useful commands. These commands come with a manual page, or at the least, if the command is built into the shell one can use the **help** command to explain the function of the command.
