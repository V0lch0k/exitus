It's been a long time since I've written anything here. I need to get back in to it. Documentation is important, and this helps remember ideas and thoughts.

There are many things that should have been written down for later reference, but life has a way of making us forget.
Sometimes the things we want to keep in our minds slip through the cracks, and those we wish to forget embed themselves firmly deep in our souls.

It's important to keep a goal in mind, and so I wish to backfill much of what is missing... with time, depending on what is allowed to be posted.
